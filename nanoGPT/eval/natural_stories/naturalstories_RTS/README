**Update 2021-10-01**: The RT for the erroneous blank token described below has been removed from the data.

**Update 2020-11-11**: In the previously-released SPR data, there was a misalignment between tokens and RTs in Story 3 starting at position 230. With the help of Luca Campanelli, we found that there was a blank token displayed in the SPR experiment after position 230, causing the RTs of subsequent tokens to be off by one. In the new alignment script `process_RTs.R` and in the new data file `processed_RTs.tsv`, we correct this mis-alignment by removing the RT for the blank token. 

-This folder contains reading time data collected for 10 naturalistic stories. Participants typically read 5 stories each. The data is contained in batch1_pro.csv and batch2_pro.csv

-all_stories.tok contains the 10 stories, with one word per row. Item is the story number, zone is the region where the word falls within the story. Note that some wordforms in all_stories.tok differ from those in words.tsv, reflecting typos in the SPR experiment as run.

-process_RTs.R reads in these files, does some light processing to eliminate bad subjects, and outputs the following:
-processed_RTs.tsv
-processed_wordinfo.tsv
